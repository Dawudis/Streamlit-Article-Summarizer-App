# Streamlit-Article-Summarizer-App
This is my first ever Streamlit App and allowed me to gain some experience with deploying models onto web applications.

This app takes a CSV dataset of article urls, scrapes them, summarizes them, and puts the summaries back into a dataset that the user can download.
